						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>Stage Fright is based in Boston, Ohio and consists of 3 members: Evan Christensen, Garfunkel Jones, and Matthew Reynolds. Garfunkel is our Bassist, Matt is our Drummer, and since no one else was willing to join our band, Evan is both our singer and our guitarist as well as our leader since he pays for all of the equipment. Recording is done in Evan's garage because even though his parents are incredibly disappointed in him, Evan is basically the only non-homeless member of the band.</p>
						<h2>Origins</h2>
						<p>One day, Matt walked into a small diner on the North side of town after a long and busy day. There, he overheard Evan talking to one of the waitresses about the singing homeless man on the side of the highway.
						  It was then that he knew the two of them were meant to be in a punk rock band. Oh, and Garfunkel was there too, sleeping in one of the empty booths. He grew tired of the noises by the highway.</p>
						<h2>Organization.</h2>
						<p>Matt is the drummer because he played bucket drums as a street performer while passing though Toledo.<br>
						Evan is the guitarist and singer because he was able to pay for lessons and learned quickly. He was promoted to leader because he pays for everything.<br>
						Garfunkel is the bassist because, like Jimi Hendrix, he was able to learn guitar without any knowledge of chords. He just plucks whatever strings make cool noises. For that reason and due to his criminal record, the amplifier's required constant flow of electricity prevents him from running off with it. He has a habit of doing that and pawning off whatever he takes for a couple of measely bucks.</p>

						<h3>Bassist</h3>
						<p>I was born and raised on the side of a highway underpass and got into music after hearing a homeless man above me singing a song.
						  Safe to say I made the right choice joining this band, though I could've sworn this was jazz.</p>

						<h3>Singer and Guitarist</h3>
						<p>My youth was spent in a rich and prosperous homestead. As a child, I thoroughly enjoyed learning math and science at my private school. 
						  I wanted to play music after hearing a homeless man singing a wonderful tune while driving by. Then my dad almost ran over a dude.</p>

						<h3>Drummer</h3>
						<p>I was born in Detroit and lived in the Petosky-Otsego neighborhood.  On my 18th birthday, my parents kicked me out because they did not have stable jobs and could not afford to keep me living there.
						  I wandered around the country working odd jobs to pay for sustenance.  These jobs were miles apart, requiring me to walk across the side of many highways just to get from place to place.  One fateful night, 
						  a car nearly hit me while I was in Ohio. I got my bearings, obviously frustrated, when I heard a homeless man singing the most beautiful song.</p>
