            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Stage Fright is based in Boston, Ohio and consists of 3 members: Evan Chritensen, Garfunkel Jones, and Matthew Reynolds. Garfunkel is our Bassist, Matt is our Drummer, and since we couldn't find anyone else willing to join the band, Evan is both our singer and our guitarist as well as our leader since he pays for all of the equipment.  Recording is done in Evan's garage because even though his parents are incredibly disappointed in him, Evan is basically the only non-homeless member of the band.
            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>One day, Matt walked into a small diner on the North side of town after a long and busy day. There, he overheard Evan talking to one of the waitresses about the singing homeless man on the side of the highway.
              It was then that he knew the two of them were meant to be in a punk rock band. Oh, and Garfunkel was there too. He was just sleeping in one of the booths.</p>
            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>Matt is the drummer because he played bucket drums as a street performer while passing though Toledo.<br>
            Evan is the guitarist and singer because he was able to pay for lessons and quickly learned. He was promoted to leader because he pays for everything.<br>
            Garfunkel is the bassist because, like Jimi Hendrix, he has absolutely no experience with the bass guitar but can pick it up and play perfectly regardless.  It also requires an amplifier, which needs to be plugged in with sufficient electricity.  This insures he doesn't try to pawn it off for a couple measely bucks.</p>

            <h3>Bassist</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised on the side of a highway underpass and got into music after hearing the homeless man on the other side sing a song.
              I thought this was a jazz band.</p>

            <h3>Singer and Guitarist</h3>
            <p>My youth was spent in a rich and prosperous homestead. As a child, I thoroughly enjoyed learning math and science at my private school. 
              I wanted to play music after hearing a homeless man singing a wonderful tune while driving by.</p>

            <h3>Drummer</h3>
            <p>I was born in Detroit and lived in the Petosky-Otsego neighborhood. My parents kicked me out because they did not have stable jobs and could not afford to keep me living there.
              I wandered around the country working odd jobs until a car nearly hit me in Ohio. Once I got my bearings, I heard a homeless man singing the most beautiful song.</p>
